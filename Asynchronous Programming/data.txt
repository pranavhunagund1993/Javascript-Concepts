A PROMISE IS A SPECIAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECT WHICH IS USED AS A PLACE HOLDER FOR THE FUTURE RESULT OF AN ASYNCHRONOUS OPERATION.
A JAVASCRIPT PROMISE, PROMISE A RESULT.
EVERY PROMISE HAS AN EXECUTER FUNCTION THAT GETS EXECUTED IMMEDIATELY WHEN WE CREATE A PROMISE.
INITIALLY, WHEN THE PROMISE IS CREATED, IT IS IN PENDING STATE. THE DATA RETURNED BY THE PROMISE IN PENDING STATE IS UNDEFINED.
THE STATE OF THE PROMISE CHANGES TO SETTLED WHEN THE PROMISE IS EITHER RESOLVED OR REJECTED.
IF THE PROMISE IS RESOLVED, THEN IT RETURNS THE RESOLVED DATA. OTHERWISE, IF THE PROMISE IS REJECTED IT RETURNS THE REJECTED DATA(i.e SOME ERROR MESSAGE).
